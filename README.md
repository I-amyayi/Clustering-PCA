As a Data Scientist working on clustering countries for HELP International using unsupervised learning, 
I aim to categorize countries based on socio-economic and health factors determining their overall development. 
HELP International, an NGO dedicated to fighting poverty and providing basic amenities and disaster relief to 
underprivileged nations, has raised approximately $10 million. The CEO now needs to strategically allocate this 
money to the countries most in need of aid. My task is to use relevant socio-economic and health factors to 
classify the countries, ultimately recommending which nations the CEO should prioritize for the most effective 
impact.
